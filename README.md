## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>


To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps. To run local server or to make any modifications
to the project NPM and Node.js must be installed.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:
To clone or fork and run it in a browser

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

For example, using Ubuntu:

```sh
  cd my-desired-folder
  git clone git@github.com:lordksix/webmetrics-webapp-cra.git
```

For more information on how to clone or fork a repository:
- <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository">How to clone a repo</a>
- <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">How to fork a repo</a>

If you want to make any kind of change or modification, Node.Js and NPM is necesary. For more information on how to install node.js and npm:
- <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">Downloading and installing Node.js and npm</a>

### Install

To install dependencies, the following command must be run in the terminal:

```sh
  cd webmetrics-webapp-cra
  npm install
```

### Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
  npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```sh
  npm run lint
```
This will check Linter error and quick fix when possible to fix.

```sh
  npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

```sh
  npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

```sh
  npm run deploy
```
Deploys the App to the gh-pages from of the current repository.

### Run tests

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```sh
  npm test
```

### Deployment

This project is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
